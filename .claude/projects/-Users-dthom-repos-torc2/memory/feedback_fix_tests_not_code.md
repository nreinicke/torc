When a test fails because production code was intentionally changed, fix or delete the test — do NOT weaken the production code to make the test pass.

**Why:** The user got frustrated when I tried to change an `expect()` in production code to `.ok()` just to make a test pass. The production code was correct; the test was outdated.

**How to apply:** When a test fails after intentional code changes, always ask whether to fix the test or confirm before modifying production code. Default to updating the test.
