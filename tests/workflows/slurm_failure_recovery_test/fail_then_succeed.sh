# This script demonstrates transient failure and recovery behavior.
#
# On the first attempt (ATTEMPT=1), it fails with exit code 42.
# On retry attempts (ATTEMPT=2+), it succeeds.
#
# Exit code 42 is configured in the failure handler to trigger automatic retry.
# The job runner will:
# 1. Detect exit code 42
# 2. Find the matching failure handler rule
# 3. Retry the job automatically (up to 2 times)
# 4. On the second run, the job succeeds

# Get the attempt number from environment or default to 1
