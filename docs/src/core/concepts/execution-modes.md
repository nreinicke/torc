# Execution Modes

Torc supports three execution modes that determine how jobs are launched and managed. The execution
mode affects resource enforcement, job termination, and integration with cluster schedulers like
Slurm.

## Overview

| Mode     | Description                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `direct` | Torc manages job execution directly without Slurm step wrapping                 |
| `slurm`  | Jobs are wrapped with `srun`, letting Slurm manage resources and termination    |
| `auto`   | Automatically selects `slurm` if `SLURM_JOB_ID` is set, otherwise uses `direct` |

Configure the execution mode in your workflow specification:

```yaml
execution_config:
  mode: direct  # or "slurm" or "auto"
```

## When to Use Each Mode

### Direct Mode

Use direct mode when:

- Running jobs **outside of Slurm** (local machine, cloud VMs, containers)
- Running inside Slurm but **srun is unreliable** or has compatibility issues
- You want Torc to **enforce memory limits** via OOM detection
- You need **custom termination signals** (e.g., SIGINT for graceful shutdown)

### Slurm Mode

Use slurm mode when:

- Running inside a **Slurm allocation** and want full Slurm integration
- You want Slurm's **cgroup-based resource enforcement**
- You need **sacct accounting** for job steps
- HPC admins need **visibility into job steps** via Slurm tools

### Auto Mode (Default)

Auto mode is the default and works well for most use cases:

- Detects Slurm by checking for `SLURM_JOB_ID` environment variable
- Uses `slurm` mode inside allocations, `direct` mode outside
- No configuration needed for portable workflows

## Direct Mode

In direct mode, Torc spawns job processes directly and manages their lifecycle without Slurm
integration.

### Resource Enforcement

When `limit_resources: true` (the default), Torc enforces resource limits:

- **Memory limits**: The resource monitor periodically samples job memory usage. If a job exceeds
  its configured memory limit, Torc sends SIGKILL and sets the exit code to `oom_exit_code` (default
  137).

- **CPU limits**: CPU counts are tracked for job scheduling but not enforced at the process level.
  Jobs may use more CPUs than requested.

- **GPU allocation**: GPU counts are tracked for scheduling. In direct mode, GPU access depends on
  system configuration (e.g., `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`).

### Termination Timeline

When a job runner reaches its `end_time` or receives a termination signal, Torc follows this
timeline:

```
end_time - sigkill_headroom - sigterm_lead:  Send termination_signal (default: SIGTERM)
                                              ↓
                              Wait sigterm_lead_seconds (default: 30s)
                                              ↓
end_time - sigkill_headroom:                 Send SIGKILL to remaining jobs
                                              ↓
                              Wait for processes to exit
                                              ↓
end_time:                                    Job runner exits
```

This gives jobs time to:

1. Receive SIGTERM and perform graceful cleanup (checkpoint, flush buffers)
2. Exit voluntarily before SIGKILL
3. Be forcefully terminated if they don't respond

### OOM Detection

The resource monitor runs in a background thread, sampling job memory usage at the configured
interval (default: 1 second in `time_series` mode). When a job's memory exceeds its limit:

1. An OOM violation is detected and logged
2. SIGKILL is sent to the job process
3. The exit code is set to `oom_exit_code` (default: 137 = 128 + SIGKILL)
4. Job status is set to `Failed`

OOM detection requires:

- `limit_resources: true`
- Resource monitor enabled (`resource_monitor.enabled: true`)
- Job has a memory limit in its `resource_requirements`

**Detection Latency**: OOM violations are detected on sample boundaries, so there is inherent
latency up to the `sample_interval_seconds` value (default: 10 seconds). A memory spike could
persist for up to one sample interval before detection. For memory-constrained environments where
faster detection is needed, reduce the sample interval:

```yaml
resource_monitor:
  enabled: true
  granularity: time_series
  sample_interval_seconds: 1  # Check every second
```

Note that `sample_interval_seconds` is an integer (fractional seconds are not supported). More
frequent sampling increases CPU overhead. For most workloads, the default 10-second interval
provides a good balance between detection speed and overhead.

### Direct Mode Configuration

```yaml
execution_config:
  mode: direct
  limit_resources: true        # Enforce memory limits (default: true)
  termination_signal: SIGTERM  # Signal sent before SIGKILL
  sigterm_lead_seconds: 30     # Seconds between SIGTERM and SIGKILL
  sigkill_headroom_seconds: 60 # Seconds before end_time for SIGKILL
  timeout_exit_code: 152       # Exit code for timed-out jobs
  oom_exit_code: 137           # Exit code for OOM-killed jobs
```

## Slurm Mode

In slurm mode, each job is wrapped with `srun`, creating a Slurm job step. This provides:

- **Cgroup isolation**: Slurm enforces CPU and memory limits via cgroups
- **Accounting**: Job steps appear in `sacct` with resource usage metrics
- **Admin visibility**: HPC admins can see and manage steps via Slurm tools
- **Automatic cleanup**: Slurm terminates steps when the allocation ends

### How srun Wrapping Works

When a job starts, Torc builds an srun command:

```bash
srun --jobid=<allocation_id> \
     --ntasks=1 \
     --exact \
     --job-name=wf<workflow_id>_j<job_id>_r<run_id>_a<attempt_id> \
     --nodes=<num_nodes> \
     --cpus-per-task=<num_cpus> \
     --mem=<memory>M \
     --gpus=<num_gpus> \
     --time=<remaining_minutes> \
     --signal=<srun_termination_signal> \
     bash -c "<job_command>"
```

Key flags:

- `--exact`: Use exactly the requested resources, allowing multiple steps to share nodes
- `--time`: Set to `remaining_time - sigkill_headroom` so steps timeout before the allocation ends
- `--signal`: Send a warning signal before step timeout (e.g., `TERM@120` sends SIGTERM 120s before)

### Resource Enforcement in Slurm Mode

When `limit_resources: true`:

- `--cpus-per-task`, `--mem`, and `--gpus` are passed to srun
- Slurm's cgroups enforce these limits
- Jobs exceeding memory are killed by Slurm with exit code 137

When `limit_resources: false`:

- CPU and memory flags are omitted
- Jobs can use any available resources in the allocation
- GPU flags are still passed (required for GPU access)

### Slurm Mode Configuration

```yaml
execution_config:
  mode: slurm
  limit_resources: true            # Pass resource limits to srun
  srun_termination_signal: TERM@120  # Send SIGTERM 120s before step timeout
  sigkill_headroom_seconds: 180    # End steps 3 minutes before allocation ends
  enable_cpu_bind: false           # Set to true to enable Slurm CPU binding
```

### Step Timeout vs Allocation End

The `sigkill_headroom_seconds` setting creates a buffer between step timeouts and allocation end:

```
Allocation start                                        Allocation end
    |                                                        |
    |   [-------- Job step runs --------]                    |
    |                                    ↑                   |
    |                          Step timeout                  |
    |                    (--time=remaining - headroom)       |
    |                                                        |
    |<---------------- sigkill_headroom_seconds ------------>|
```

This ensures:

1. Steps timeout with Slurm's `TIMEOUT` status (exit code 152)
2. The job runner has time to collect results and report to the server
3. The allocation doesn't end while jobs are still running

## Disabling Resource Limits

Set `limit_resources: false` to disable resource enforcement:

```yaml
execution_config:
  mode: direct  # or slurm
  limit_resources: false
```

Effects:

| Feature                | limit_resources: true     | limit_resources: false  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Memory limits (direct) | OOM detection and SIGKILL | No enforcement          |
| Memory limits (slurm)  | srun --mem passed         | --mem omitted           |
| CPU limits (slurm)     | srun --cpus-per-task      | --cpus-per-task omitted |
| GPU allocation         | Always passed to srun     | Always passed to srun   |
| Timeout termination    | Enforced                  | Enforced                |

Note: GPU allocation is always requested regardless of `limit_resources` because jobs need explicit
GPU access in Slurm.

## Exit Codes

Torc uses specific exit codes to identify termination reasons:

| Exit Code | Meaning                    | Default | Configuration Key   |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| 137       | OOM killed (128 + SIGKILL) | Yes     | `oom_exit_code`     |
| 152       | Timeout (Slurm convention) | Yes     | `timeout_exit_code` |

These match Slurm's conventions, making it easy to handle failures consistently across execution
modes.

## Example Configurations

### Local Development

```yaml
execution_config:
  mode: direct
  limit_resources: false  # Don't enforce limits during development
```

### Production HPC

```yaml
execution_config:
  mode: auto  # Use slurm inside allocations
  limit_resources: true
  srun_termination_signal: TERM@120
  sigkill_headroom_seconds: 300
```

### Graceful Shutdown with Custom Signal

```yaml
execution_config:
  mode: direct
  termination_signal: SIGINT  # Send SIGINT instead of SIGTERM
  sigterm_lead_seconds: 60    # Give jobs 60s to handle SIGINT
  sigkill_headroom_seconds: 90
```

### Strict Memory Enforcement

```yaml
resource_monitor:
  enabled: true
  granularity: time_series
  sample_interval_seconds: 1

execution_config:
  mode: direct
  limit_resources: true
  oom_exit_code: 137
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Execution Mode

The job runner logs the effective execution mode at startup:

```
INFO Job runner starting workflow_id=1 ... execution_mode=Direct limit_resources=true
```

### View Termination Events

Termination events are logged with context:

```
INFO Jobs terminating workflow_id=1 count=3
INFO Job SIGTERM workflow_id=1 job_id=42
INFO Waiting 30s for graceful termination before SIGKILL
INFO Job SIGKILL workflow_id=1 job_id=42
```

### OOM Violations

OOM violations are logged with memory details:

```
WARN OOM violation detected: workflow_id=1 job_id=42 pid=12345 memory=2.50GB limit=2.00GB
WARN Killing OOM job workflow_id=1 job_id=42
```
