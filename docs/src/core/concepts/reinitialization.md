# Workflow Reinitialization

When you modify input files or configuration after a workflow has run, you need a way to re-execute
only the affected jobs. Reinitialization handles this by detecting what changed and marking the
appropriate jobs for re-execution.

## When to Use Reinitialization

Use `torc workflows reinit` when:

- **Input files changed** — You modified an input file and want dependent jobs to rerun
- **Configuration updated** — You changed user_data parameters
- **Output files missing** — Output files were deleted and need regeneration
- **Job definition changed** — You modified a job's command or other attributes
- **Iterative development** — You're refining a workflow and need quick iteration

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Preview what would change (recommended first step)
torc workflows reinit <workflow_id> --dry-run

# Reinitialize the workflow
torc workflows reinit <workflow_id>

# Force reinitialization even with warnings
torc workflows reinit <workflow_id> --force
```

## How Change Detection Works

Reinitialization detects changes through three mechanisms:

### 1. File Modification Times

For files tracked in the workflow, Torc compares the current `st_mtime` (modification time) against
the stored value. If a file was modified since the last run, jobs that use it as input are marked
for re-execution.

```bash
# Modify an input file
echo "new data" > input.json

# Reinitialize detects the change
torc workflows reinit <workflow_id>
# Output: Reset 3 jobs due to changed inputs
```

### 2. Job Attribute and User Data Hashing

Torc computes SHA256 hashes of critical job attributes (such as the command) and `user_data` input
values. If any hash differs from the stored value, the job is marked for re-execution. This detects
changes like modified commands, updated scripts, or changed configuration parameters.

### 3. Missing Output Files

If a job's output file no longer exists on disk, the job is marked for re-execution regardless of
whether inputs changed.

## The Reinitialization Process

When you run `reinitialize`, Torc performs these steps:

1. **Bump run_id** — Increments the workflow's run counter for tracking
2. **Reset workflow status** — Clears the previous run's completion state
3. **Check file modifications** — Compares current `st_mtime` values to stored values
4. **Check missing outputs** — Identifies jobs whose output files no longer exist
5. **Check user_data changes** — Computes and compares input hashes
6. **Mark affected jobs** — Sets jobs needing re-execution to `uninitialized`
7. **Re-evaluate dependencies** — Runs `initialize_jobs` to set jobs to `ready` or `blocked`

## Dependency Propagation

When a job is marked for re-execution, all downstream jobs that depend on its outputs are also
marked. This ensures the entire dependency chain is re-executed:

```
preprocess (input changed) → marked for rerun
    ↓
process (depends on preprocess output) → also marked
    ↓
postprocess (depends on process output) → also marked
```

## Dry Run Mode

Always use `--dry-run` first to preview changes without modifying anything:

```bash
torc workflows reinit <workflow_id> --dry-run
```

Example output:

```
Dry run: 5 jobs would be reset due to changed inputs
  - preprocess
  - analyze_batch_1
  - analyze_batch_2
  - merge_results
  - generate_report
```

## Async Reinitialization

Reinitialization runs asynchronously on the server: `torc workflows reinit` returns as soon as the
work is queued, with a task ID that identifies the background operation. This matters for workflows
with many jobs, where rebuilding the dependency graph can take several seconds to minutes.

To block on completion, use `torc tasks wait`:

```bash
# Capture the task ID from the reinit response
task_id=$(torc -f json workflows reinit <workflow_id> | jq -r .task_id)

# Wake on SSE completion, with polling as a fallback
torc tasks wait --timeout 300 "$task_id"
```

A few properties worth knowing:

- **One active task per workflow operation.** If you invoke `reinit` again while a previous task is
  still running, the second call returns `409 Conflict` with the existing task's ID. Wait on that
  task instead of starting a new one.
- **Crash-safe.** Tasks are persisted server-side. If the server restarts while a reinit is
  in-flight, the task is marked `failed` with an explanatory error on startup, so clients polling or
  waiting receive a terminal state rather than hanging.
- **Dry-run is synchronous.** `--dry-run` does not create a task; it returns the preview directly.

## Retrying Failed Jobs

**Important:** Reinitialization does not automatically retry failed jobs. To retry failed jobs, use
`reset-status`:

```bash
# Reset failed jobs to ready status, then reinitialize to check for other changes
torc workflows reset-status <workflow_id> --failed-only --reinitialize

# Or just reset failed jobs without reinitialization
torc workflows reset-status <workflow_id> --failed-only
```

## Comparison with Full Reset

| Scenario                 | Use `reinitialize`  | Use `reset-status`        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Input file changed       | Yes                 | No                        |
| Job command changed      | Yes                 | No                        |
| Want to rerun everything | No                  | Yes                       |
| Retry failed jobs only   | No                  | **Yes** (`--failed-only`) |
| Iterative development    | Yes                 | Depends                   |
| Changed workflow spec    | Create new workflow | Create new workflow       |
