# Introduction

**Torc** is a distributed workflow orchestration system for managing computational pipelines ranging
from simple workflows needing to parallelize independent jobs to complex workflows with job
dependencies, mixed resource requirements, and multiple stages.

## Key Features

- **Declarative Workflow Definitions** — Define workflows in YAML, JSON, JSON5, or KDL
- **Job Parameterization** — Create parameter sweeps with simple syntax like `index: "1:100"` to
  expand one job definition into hundreds ([tutorial](./core/tutorials/simple-params.md))
- **Automatic Dependency Resolution** — Dependencies inferred from file and data relationships. No
  explicit `depends_on` declarations needed—Torc builds the dependency graph from your data flow
  ([tutorial](./core/tutorials/diamond.md))
- **Distributed Execution** — Run jobs across local machines, HPC clusters, and networked compute
  nodes
- **Resource Management** — Track CPU and memory usage across all jobs
- **Automatic Failure Recovery** — Detect OOM/timeout failures and retry with adjusted resources
- **Fault Tolerance** — Resume workflows after failures without losing progress
- **AI-assisted configuration and management** — Use AI tools like Claude Code and Copilot to
  configure workflows and diagnose problems
- **Inline Commands with `torc -s exec`** — Run one command (or a queue of them) in standalone mode
  with CPU/memory monitoring and parallelism control, no spec file or running server required
  ([how-to](./core/how-to/run-inline-commands.md))

## Who Should Use Torc?

Torc is designed for:

- **HPC Users** who need to parallelize jobs across cluster resources
- **Computational Scientists** running parameter sweeps and simulations
- **Data Engineers** building complex data processing pipelines
- **ML/AI Researchers** managing training workflows and hyperparameter searches
- **Anyone** who needs reliable, resumable workflow orchestration
